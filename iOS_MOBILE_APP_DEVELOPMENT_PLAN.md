## 1. iOS App Architecture and Technical Foundation

### 1.1 Technical Architecture Overview

The HotGigs.ai iOS application will be built using a modern, scalable architecture that prioritizes performance, maintainability, and seamless integration with the existing backend infrastructure. The application will follow the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, enhanced with Combine framework for reactive programming and SwiftUI for declarative user interface development.

The core architecture consists of several interconnected layers designed to provide separation of concerns and facilitate testing. The presentation layer will utilize SwiftUI views bound to ViewModels that manage state and business logic. The service layer will handle API communication, data transformation, and caching strategies. The data layer will manage local storage using Core Data for complex relational data and UserDefaults for simple preferences and settings.

Network communication will be implemented using URLSession with custom networking layers that provide automatic retry mechanisms, request/response logging, and error handling. The application will implement a robust caching strategy using NSCache for in-memory storage and Core Data for persistent offline access. Authentication will be managed through a dedicated service that handles JWT token storage, refresh mechanisms, and biometric authentication integration.

The application will support both iPhone and iPad interfaces through adaptive layouts that automatically adjust to different screen sizes and orientations. Universal app deployment will ensure a single binary that provides optimized experiences across all iOS device categories while maintaining code reusability and reducing maintenance overhead.

### 1.2 Technology Stack and Frameworks
